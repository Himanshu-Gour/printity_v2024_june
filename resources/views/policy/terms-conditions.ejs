      <p class="policies_paragraph">
        Printity defines defective products as a structural or printing error(s) from manufacturing, improper
        construction, cut, or finish. Due to the nature of paperboard, cracking can occur when creased in printed areas
        as a result of over-expansion in paperboard material. Minor cracking in the creased areas for non-laminated
        cardstock is normal and not classified as defective. Cracking, bends, or scratches produced as a result of
        mishandling or shipping are not considered to be defective. printity is responsible for all manufacturing errors
        and will re-produce, re-print, or provide a refund for damages under the discretion of printity management.
        Customers are encouraged to report defective products immediately upon receiving their order
